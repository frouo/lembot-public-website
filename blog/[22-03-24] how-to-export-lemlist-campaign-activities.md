# Lemlist Campaign Activities

If you want to deep dive into your data, you would probably want to analyze your campaign **activities**.

This is the most enriched data in lemlist.

Every single email sent, opened, clicked, URL clicked, etc. is an activity. And they are all timestamped.

## How to Export Activities

Lemlist does not provide a way to export them.

Lembot does ðŸ˜Ž

### Create a Bot

When creating a bot, you will be asked what type of data you want to export : reports or **activitites**.

![export lemlist activities - new bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/163671763-176d55d2-23ee-4049-a62f-f9c153ee7485.jpg)

Follow the steps to finish creating bot:

- choose your lemlist team and campaign to export the activities from
- choose your Google spreadsheet, sheet and cell from which to import the activities
- eventually, schedule automatic export
- save the bot

### Click Run Bot

Few seconds later, all your campaign activities are exported in your gsheet.

## First Time Event

If you only care about the first occurence of an event, check out the column `isFirst`.

## Steps

The column `sequenceStep` tells you the step when the event occured.

Watch out, index starts at 0. Meaning that

- `0` means "step 1"
- `1` means "step 2"
- and so on.

## Clicked URL

If your prospect clicks on link in your email, an activity of type `emailsClicked` is created and the clicked URL is available in the column `extra.location`.

## Event Types

Here is the list of all the lemlist event types available in the export

- emailsSent

# Export your lemlist reports

Lemlist campaign **report** gives another overview of your campaign results. It can be downloaded as a CSV file on your computer, right? How about automating this task?

With lembot, it is super easy to automatically export your campaign results into your GSheet.

Here is how:

1. create a new bot
2. select the data you want to extract from lemlist: "**reports**"
3. follow the steps: choose your lemlist team, campaign, google spreadsheet and destination sheet
4. _eventually, re-arrange your data_ ([see how ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://lembot.com/blog/keep-your-lemlist-export-minimalist-and-consistent))
5. _eventually, schedule automatic daily export_ ([see how ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://lembot.com/blog/schedule-exports))
6. save

Your automation is ready. That simple üí™

Now, whenever you need to export your Lemlist reports in Google Sheets, just click "**Run Bot**". Or schedule **automatic daily export** ‚úåÔ∏è

# Welcome

Let me introduce you to lembot.

## What is lembot

Lembot is an online automation tool dedicated to [lemlist](https://lemlist.com).

Lembot automatically exports your Lemlist data (reports, activities, leads) into your Google Sheets.

Lembot aims to be your automation partner throughout your journey with Lemlist 🚀

Last but not least, lembot is not affialiated with lemlist. That said, I had the chance to meet G. who loves the idea and wishes the best for the project.

## Why

Exporting CSV files by hand is time consuming and error-prone.

Lemlist reporting is great, but can't be customized. By exporting your data into Google Sheets, you can build the reporting of your dreams. There is no limit.

## Based on your feedback

We are regularly adding new features based on your feedback and our own ideas.

New features are announced in the newsletter and listed [here ↗️](https://lembot.com/whats-new)

Feel free to reach us at [francois@lembot.com](mailto:francois@lembot.com), or by chat (cf. bottom-right bubble) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoisrouault/) if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Who is behind

I am François, the maker of [lembot.com](https://lembot.com) 👋 and fan of the lemlist's team, tools and growth.

I am a lemlister like you and build lembot to boost my productivity.

## date of birth

Lembot has been officially announced on Twitter on May 4th 2021.

# Google API error - [400] Invalid requests[0].pasteData: This action would increase the number of cells in the workbook above the limit of 10 000 000 cells.

![Google Sheets limit of 10 000 000 cells](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/209356372-4f453aba-b3d0-4b6b-a3d8-2036481ad23e.jpg)

## Why this error?

Import to Google Sheets failed because this action would exceed the max limit of 10 million cells per spreadsheet.

This is a Google API limitations for spreadsheets:

> Up to 10 million cells or 18,278 columns (column ZZZ) for spreadsheets that are created in or converted to Google Sheets.

## How to fix it?

Here are some ways to avoid this error:

- Move sheet in another spreadsheet
- Reduce the number of campaigns in your megabot

## Pay attention: it's 10.000.000 cells per spreadsheet, not per sheet!

A Google spreadsheet is made of multiple sheets.

The limitation applies to the spreadsheet, in other words to the sum of the cells of its sheets.

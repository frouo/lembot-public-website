# Lembot v2: Simpler, More Powerful

Today, we are excited to announce Lembot v2 🎉

After listening to your feedback over the past years, we've completely redesigned the bot creation experience to make it simpler and more intuitive.

## What's new?

### One bot to rule them all

Remember when you had to choose between creating a "bot" or a "megabot"? That's gone.

In Lembot v2, there's just **one type of bot**. Simple, powerful, and flexible enough to handle everything from single campaigns to bulk exports.

### Very straightforward

Creating an export automation is now incredibly straightforward:

#### Step 1: Choose what to export

Select the data you want to export from your Lemlist campaigns:

- **Results** — Overview of your campaign performance
- **Activities** — Every email opened, clicked, replied, timestamped
- **Leads** — All lead details with custom variables
- **Tasks** — Task details, types, and due dates

#### Step 2: Select your Lemlist team

Choose which Lemlist team to connect to (perfect if you manage multiple teams or clients).

#### Step 3: Choose the campaigns to export

This is where the magic happens. You now have **3 flexible options**:

**Manual selection**: Pick campaigns one by one from your list. Perfect when you want precise control.

**By tags**: Export all campaigns with specific tags automatically. Ideal for organizing exports by client, project, or campaign type.

**All**: Export every active campaign at once. Set it and forget it - new campaigns are automatically included as long as they're active.

## What happens to my old bots and megatbots?

Your existing bots and megabots will continue to work exactly as they do today.

However, they are now _deprecated_, which means we won't be adding new features or providing support for them going forward.

## Easy migration

We've made migration as painless as possible.

If you have custom columns in your old bots or megabots, simply:

1. Click "Copy fields" in your old bot
2. Paste them into your new v2 bot

That's it! Your custom configuration is preserved.

## Ready to try v2?

Head over to your [Lembot dashboard](https://lembot.com/dashboard) and create your first v2 bot. The interface will guide you through each step.

And as always, if you have any questions or feedback, just [send me an email](mailto:francois@lembot.com) or use the chat. I read everything and your input shapes the future of lembot.

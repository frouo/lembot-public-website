# Setup your google sheets for lembot

Without your explicit permission, lembot cannot edit your Google Sheets and you will get a Google API error `[403] The caller does not have permission`.

Giving permission is super easy.

## Option 1: share with people

As easy as sharing the spreadsheet to your best friend, with `editor` rights.

Here your best friend is lembot which email is:

**lembot@lembot.iam.gserviceaccount.com**

## Option 2: get link

Even easier but I do not recommend because it is less secured.

Click **Get link**, choose **Anyone with the link** and select **Editor** rights.

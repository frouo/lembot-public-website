# Bulk export campaign reports

Picture this, you have 26 campaigns that you want to export all at once in one single sheet:

- **Campaign A**
- **Campaign B**
- ‚¨áÔ∏è
- **Campaign Z**

Lembot allows you to automates this in just a few clicks.

It's super easy, it's super powerful, it's called **megabot** ‚úåÔ∏è

## Create megabot

Here is how to create a megabot:

1. In your dashboard, click "Create a Megabot" button
2. Go through the 5 steps configuration guide
3. Click "Save"

And that's it!

You can choose to schedule your megabots so you don't even have to click the button "Run Megabot".

## See it in action

In this video, you can see that the megabot is exporting the campaign "Nouvelle campagne Maxime (CGP)", followed by the campaign "Nouvelle campagne Sihem".

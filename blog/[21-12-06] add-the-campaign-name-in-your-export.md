# Add the campaign name in your export

With lembot you can add the campaign name in your export.

Lembot will automatically insert a new column called `campaignName` and add the campaign name in front of every leads of your export.

![column campaignName](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151704171-b7e0f5a1-420f-4ee6-bd8e-affbb7c9e2df.png)

## How To

While creating or editing a bot, just select the option "Add the campaign name".

That's it.

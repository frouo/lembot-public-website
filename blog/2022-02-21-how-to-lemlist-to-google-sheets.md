# How to Lemlist to Google Sheets

If you want to analyze the results of your campaign more deeply, you can export them from lemlist and import them back to Google Sheets.

At this point you have the power of Google Sheets to make your data meaningful, draw stats, etc.

## The easy way

Use lembot 💪

Lembot is an online automation tool that automates the export of your lemlist campaign results into your Google Sheets.

All you need to do is to create a `Bot`. A bot is like a zap for Zapier.

It is super easy:

- Step1: paste your lemlist API keys, all your campaigns appear automatically so you select the one to export
- Step2: paste your gsheet URL, all your sheets appear automatically so you can select in which one to import the data
- (optionally) schedule automatic export
- click Save

That's it 🤩

Now click "Export" whenever you need a fresh export of your campaign results.

## The hard way

Do it all by hand.

Without lembot things get harder. Here are the steps you need to follow to achieve the same result, all by hand:

- open your lemlist dashboard
- open Reports
- find and select your campaign
- click Export
- wait until the export is ready 😴
- download the CSV
- open your Google spreadsheet
- click File 
- hover Import, click
- click the Upload tab
- click Select a file from your device
- find the right CSV among others on your computer, good luck when file name looks like `fil_axp_CvGPWvb3AxzDbFhJQ_campaign_x.csv` 🤯
- choose the right options for your import
- and finally, click Import data

Let's be honest, it's time-consuming, error-prone work with 0 added value.

That's why we created lembot to automate everything listed above so you can focus your time and your brain to bring value to your business.

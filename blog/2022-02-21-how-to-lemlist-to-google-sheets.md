# How to Lemlist to Google Sheets

If you want to analyze the **results of your campaigns** more deeply, you would probably want to import them into Google Sheets.

Here is how to do it.

## The easy way

Use lembot 💪

Lembot automates the export of your lemlist campaign results (or activities) to your GSheet.

Follow the step-by-step guide to create your automation:

- **step 1**: paste your lemlist API key. At this point lembot automatically presents your campaigns so you can select the one you want to import in Google Sheets.
- **step 2**: paste your gsheet URL. At this point lembot automatically presents your spreadsheet's sheets so you can select where you want to import your campaign data.
- optionally, select which columns to import, schedule automatic export, etc.
- click **Save** and / or **Run Export**

That's it 🤩

Once setup you can run your automation in 1 click, or automatically if you scheduled it (daily, on weekdays, weekly, monthly).

## The hard way

Do it all by hand. 

Without lembot things get harder. Here are the steps you need to follow to achieve the same result, all by hand, again, again and all over again every time you want fresh data or change campaigns:

- open your lemlist dashboard
- find and click on your campaign
- click Export
- wait until the export is ready 😴
- download the CSV
- open your Google spreadsheet
- click File
- hover Import, click
- click the Upload tab
- click Select a file from your device
- find the right CSV among others on your computer, good luck when file name looks like `fil_axp_CvGPWvb3AxzDbFhJQ_campaign_x.csv` 🤯
- choose the right options for your import
- and finally, click Import data

Let's be honest, it's time-consuming and error-prone work with 0 added value.

Lembot automates all this for you so you can focus on your business.

Looking for a way to **export Lemlist reports by tags** or simply **export all Lemlist campaigns at once** into your Google Sheets? With Lembot’s new Megabot modes, you can automate your Lemlist exports in minutes—filter by tags or grab every campaign in one go.

## Why export lemlist reports by tags

- **Dynamic dashboards**: Only include campaigns tagged "LinkedIn" or "Q3-2025" so new campaigns flow in automatically.
- **Focused analysis**: Narrow down to high-value segments (e.g. VIP leads, segmented outreach) without manual updates.
- **Time-saver**: Eliminate repetitive manual selection — set it and forget it.

## FAQs

### Can I mix "By tags" and "All campaigns" in one Megabot?

Not in the same run — choose one mode per Megabot. For combined exports, set up two Megabots: one for "By tags" and one for "All campaigns."

### What if I add new tags later?

In **By tags** mode, any new campaign tagged with your selected labels will automatically appear in your next export.

### Where do I find the exported sheet?

Your Google Sheet and worksheet are defined when you configure the Megabot — open that Sheet in Google Drive to view the latest data.

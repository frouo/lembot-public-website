# What's New

All new updates and improvements to lembot.

Have an feature idea for lembot? Feel free to chat or [email](mailto:francois@lembot.com) me.

## March 7, 2025

Now you can export your campaign tasks! :)

---

## May 13, 2023

Lembot now automatically resolves duplicate header conflicts! If any.

If your custom variables have the same name as a column in a Lemlist report, such as "notes", Lembot will now automatically rename subsequent occurrences with a suffix (e.g. notes | notes (1) | notes (2)...). This ensures you can continue using your custom variables without interruption.

---

## April 4, 2023

- Add your campaign [Tags](https://help.lemlist.com/en/articles/5071155-organize-your-campaigns-like-a-pro-with-tags) to your export to simplify your analysis. See:

![export lemlist tags](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/230055689-ec8c7f15-ee15-4252-9a38-91488c89810f.jpg)

_March 2025 update: the column has been renamed `campaignTags` to match with Lemlist._

- Convert Lemlist dates into a format that is compatible with Google Sheets, enabling dates analysis, sorting and much nicer readability. No more dates like `2021-05-10T08:07:36.526Z` in your sheets, but this instead:

![google sheets date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/229836893-3e1ebb62-3a88-4eb8-b067-348148d8157e.png)

## Dec 22, 2023

We've been working on a new "help center" article series for our Blog page. This resource will be a great help to many of you.

## Jun 2, 2022

Export lemlist leads: custom variables, email, firstName, lastName, etc.

![export leads spotlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/171725430-bf1e5336-ab0c-444a-b984-de02bc4664bd.jpg)

## March 24, 2022

Export lemlist **activities**. All of them.

Every single event that occurs in lemlist is now available to export: emails sent, opened, clicked, etc. with the date of the interaction, the lead and sender data, the clicked URL.

Everything is now available.

Exclusively on lembot.

![export activities bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/163671803-e3651137-488e-48be-bb97-cdf245c4b1c7.jpg)

## Jan 20, 2022

Let me introduce you to **megabots**.

Megabot allows you to export campaigns in bulk. Your campaigns appear in the same sheet, one below the other, with `campaignName` as first column and for the other columns, lembot will automatically make the match across campaigns üß†

![megabot demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151619169-61db8931-d5f9-4808-8a52-28b4e7644629.mp4)

## Nov 30, 2021

The exports are now launched in background, no need to wait! Run export returns quickly and you are informed of the status of the export : `loading`, `running`, `done`.

In addition, you can see the time taken for the export. That's as many seconds saved in your day, without even counting all the mouse operations of course ;)

![20211130 - run export in background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151620051-58e57e06-4f21-4ebb-afe1-1f32ef55611e.mp4)

## Oct 19, 2021

Lembot now supports scheduling üéâ

Meaning that you can schedule export daily, weekly or monthly at the exact hour and minute you want.

I am very proud as it has been requested a lot and so tricky to develop. A lot has changed in the inside of lembot to make this possible. It is one of the most exciting news for lembot so far.

![20210929 - scheduling (highlight)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151621516-2b3de5fc-ef0a-4a12-bb0d-e0f1df9a4025.jpg)

Something great happens, lembot is now faster than ever üöÄ

I have been working for months on migrating lembot's server offering now faster website, dashboard, exports, everything.

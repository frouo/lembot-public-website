## March 24, 2022

Export lemlist **activities**. All of them.

Every single event that occurs in lemlist is now available to export: emails sent, opened, clicked, etc. with the date of the interaction, the lead and sender data, the clicked URL.

Everything is now available.

Exclusively on lembot.

![export activities bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/163671803-e3651137-488e-48be-bb97-cdf245c4b1c7.jpg)

Let me introduce you to **megabots**.

Megabot allows you to export campaigns in bulk. Your campaigns appear in the same sheet, one below the other, with `campaignName` as first column and for the other columns, lembot will automatically make the match across campaigns 🧠

![megabot demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151619169-61db8931-d5f9-4808-8a52-28b4e7644629.mp4)

## Nov 30, 2021

The exports are now launched in background, no need to wait! Run export returns quickly and you are informed of the status of the export : `loading`, `running`, `done`.

In addition, you can see the time taken for the export. That's as many seconds saved in your day, without even counting all the mouse operations of course ;)

![20211130 - run export in background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151620051-58e57e06-4f21-4ebb-afe1-1f32ef55611e.mp4)

Lembot now supports scheduling 🎉

Meaning that you can schedule export daily, weekly or monthly at the exact hour and minute you want.

I am very proud as it has been requested a lot and so tricky to develop. A lot has changed in the inside of lembot to make this possible. It is one of the most exciting news for lembot so far.

![20210929 - scheduling (highlight)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151621516-2b3de5fc-ef0a-4a12-bb0d-e0f1df9a4025.jpg)

## Oct 5, 2021

Added pattern validation to avoid typos while creating new bot.

![A1 address validation pattern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2499356/151621650-c6b323ca-a42d-4e3e-b03a-f791e8d077f9.jpg)

Something great happens, lembot is now faster than ever 🚀

I have been working for months on migrating lembot's server offering now faster website, dashboard, exports, everything.

Enjoy!

And, another great news... This upgrade was necessary to enable the scheduling. Yes, scheduling is almost there, I am actively testing it, stay tuned 🤩
